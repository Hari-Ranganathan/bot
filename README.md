This is the twitter bot sample programming.

The bot will read the status form the file and put it as status every morning 8'o clock  in the following twitter accont

I have used the tweepy for accessing the twitter api's and the scheduler.

webscrpper.py will be used to scrape a data from the website and put the status in the twitter, and if it is failed message will be triggered to the whatsapp using twilio with reason of the failure.
